"boggart/5","x699"
"boggart/6","Marika's tits, you must be 'ungry."
"boggart/7","Pft!"
"boggart/8","*Whisper* Sister you will love to hear this."
"boggart/9","Brother. There are her statues and paintings all over the land."
"boggart/10","Ah but you see dear sister, a ""good"" rumour yields potency as much as evidence."
"boggart/11","People adore anecdotes. Our minds are fashioned to focus on peculiars amidst the banals."
"boggart/12","And imagine their face when they see the real things!"
"boggart/13","Miquella, you are most fearsome in a peculiar way."
"boggart/14","But very well. Do be careful not to catch mother's ire. "
"boggart/15","Of course, dear sister. Of course."
"boggart/16","All right, here you go, mate."
"boggart/17","Thank you."
"boggart/18","Tarnished. Hold a moment."
"boggart/19","Why must thee waste thy runes on these boiled crustaceans?"
"boggart/20","Thou just spent 419,400 runes. That is almost the soul of a god."
"boggart/21","My beloved."
"boggart/22","Wonderful."
"boggart/23","*Sigh* Fine. Fine. Do share some with Blaidd and Iji later."
"boggart/24","Bah, go have your lover spat somewhere else."

"boggart/31","Do you wish to, brother?"
"boggart/32","Mhmm!"
"boggart/33","You heard him."
"boggart/34","Perfect. A moment then."
"boggart/35","There ya go. Cooked up fresh."
"boggart/36","Good."
"boggart/37","Careful of the heat, brother."
"boggart/38","Mhmm…..."
"boggart/39","Well, would you like some more takeaway back home, brother?"
"boggart/40","Of course, sister! We should get for Lorretta and Finlay too."
"boggart/41","Ah. Afraid am all out for the day."
"boggart/42","What about those in the pot?"
"boggart/43","These are for me self. A man gotta eat after a hard day of work. "
"boggart/44","Come back next day, eh?"
"boggart/45","Hmm, forgive me a moment brother."
"boggart/46","Sell me those. Take that big one as a compensation."
"boggart/47","Bloody hell. You drive a tight bargain, lady."
"boggart/48","Well fine. But since you like it so much, help spread the word of my venture eh?"
"boggart/49","Hmm. I suppose we can do that."
"boggart/50","Blackguard Big Boggart became known as the Lord of Seafoods some years thenceforth."
"boggart/51","And the exaltation of Marika's bosoms spread like wildfire ever after with the help of a certain golden boy. "
"boggart/52","Thus, born her less-spoken but all-known moniker, Marika the Bountiful, despite their modest size in truth."

"meta/5","Sister."
"meta/6","Trina"
"meta/7","I think I am gay now."
"meta/8","WHAT!?"
"meta/9","Make Michael stop… Don’t turn the poor Miquella into an idiot…"
"meta/10","You must kill Miquella."
"meta/11","Save him from this undeserved fate of a retcon."
"crab/1","You again. Back for more?"
"crab/2","Yes! My sister give me some pocket changes. How much are your produces again?"
"crab/3","Very good, chief. Fleshly boiled prawn for 600 runes and crab for 800 runes. Just for you."

"crab/5","One boiled crab, please!"
"crab/6","One boiled prawn, please!"
"crab/7","Mhmm, juicy!"
"crab/8","Hmm I still want more, what should I do next?"
"crab/9","Ahh so good! I must come back for more next day!"
"crab/10","Aww, I am out of runes. I am not sated at all! I must come back again tomorrow."

"teaparty/6","Miquella! Not at all. Come, come."
"teaparty/7","Hello, everyone! Thank you all for joining me for today's party."
"teaparty/8","But uhh... I should mention that I still have never attended a real tea party before."
"teaparty/9","So our gathering today may not be truly authentic."
"teaparty/10","Not to worry. We all trust you to make this party a great one regardless."
"teaparty/11","Mhm. Thank you, Trina."
"teaparty/12","Well then, let's start our little party. I have prepared enough for everyone!"
"teaparty/13","Meep meep!"
"teaparty/14","Lovely!"
"teaparty/15","Here we have Red Tea from Ranah! Freshly brewed and good to drink."
"teaparty/16","Thank you, dear Miquella. So, do we need to do anything before we drink?"
"teaparty/17","Hmm. I think we are to do a cup clinking to start."
"teaparty/18","Cup clinking? Like a toast?"
"teaparty/19","Well, similar purpose. But we hit our cups together and cheer... I think."
"teaparty/20","Oh, I see. Here we go then."
"teaparty/21","Thanks, Miquella. For the party today, cheer!"
"teaparty/22","Meep!"
"teaparty/23","Meow!"
"teaparty/24","Ah, thank you. Cheers to you all as well!"
"teaparty/25","Hmm, what a peculiar scent. A mix of young wood, earthy, and… something sharp?"
"teaparty/26","Kind of an unexpected smell from a drink, right?"
"teaparty/27","Indeed. It sure seems to get lot of things mixed in. Let's have a try."
"teaparty/28","Aah, so many flovours."
"teaparty/29","A bit sweet, smooth, and tingly. Oh, what is this warmth throughout?"
"teaparty/30","I am told it is because of the mixture of medicinal spices."
"teaparty/31","Here, have a try with this honey date loaf!"
"teaparty/32","So soft and sweet. Yum!"
"teaparty/33","They go quite well together. \n Very nice!"
"teaparty/34","I am glad to hear!"
"teaparty/35","And we also have almond honey ice creams."
"teaparty/36","Cherry jam breads."
"teaparty/37","Gingerbreads."
"teaparty/38","Rose puddings."
"teaparty/39","Saffron cheesecakes."
"teaparty/40","And berry pies. Take your pick!"
