For any suggestions or bugs, feel free to report them in the [**Issues**](https://github.com/remance/Royal-Ordains/issues)
page.

Maybe I will keep expanding on it enough into a full story game beyond Elden Ring fan animation in the future. Will see.

Also include custom animation maker:

Can be used to make a comic as well I guess:
